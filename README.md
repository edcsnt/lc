<h4 align="center">Solutions to LeetCode problems written in Python 3</h4>

The algorithm or technique used, the time complexity, the auxiliary space, and
the optimality are given as comments at the top of each file. Optimality always
favors time.

Built-in sorting algorithms from standard libraries are considered to require
$O(1)$ auxiliary space as
[heapsort](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/512274.512284) exists, even
though implementations such as Java's `Arrays.sort()`'s
[dual-pivot quicksort](http://www.kriche.com.ar/root/programming/spaceTimeComplexity/DualPivotQuicksort.pdf)
and Python's `list.sort()`'s
[powersort](https://www.wild-inter.net/publications/munro-wild-2018.pdf)
actually need $O(\mathop{{}^{}\mathrm{lb}} n)$ and $O(n)$ space, respectively.
